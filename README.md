# Kero Blaster
An open-source recreation of the game Kero Blaster by Studio Pixel. You **need** a legal copy of the game in order to use this repo, as it just builds an executable!

## When Will This Be Playable?
When it gets done. I will try to set this up in a way so you can play what I have so far but it'll likely take a long time for this project to reach that stage.

## Purpose
* Kero Blaster is present on a variety of different platforms with different versions.
* It is also a good amount of work to set up an injection toolchain for modding.
* By recreating an executable, mods can be made more flexible by allowing an easy way to modify the game's code and to build for any desired platform.

## Disclaimers
* Piracy is a non-goal, and not possible with this remake. You need to place the `rsc_k` folder that comes with your game in the same location as the built executable. Do not share this folder with anyone, please support Studio Pixel and buy the game.
* Anyone who has access to code from Kero Blaster or has access to leaked code from the game is banned from contributing. This is to ensure every part of game logic is created and not stolen.
* There may be oddities or differences from the recreation that the original game does not have, as while accuracy with how the game plays is a priority, it is not possible without either the source of the game or a matching decompilation project. However, this recreation should be "close enough".
